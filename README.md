# Serverless-Trading-Bot
Automated Serverless Crypto Currency and Stock Trading Bot

## Introduction
This project uses serverless aws lambda functions to create an api to trade assets. Use TradingView or programmatically make trades based on certain conditions. 

Currently includes a connector for the Coinbase Pro API to trade crypto currencies. 
In the works is a connector for Alpaca trading API which will allow you to trade stocks as well.

By integrating TradingView you can set buy and sell signals based on whatever indicators or market conditions you want. 
You can create a fully automated trading bot that buys and sells assets, although this is not recommended* (see disclaimer).
