# Serverless-Trading-Bot
Automated Serverless Crypto Currency and Stock Trading Bot

## Introduction
This project uses serverless aws lambda functions to create an api to trade assets. Use TradingView or programmatically make trades based on certain conditions. 

Currently includes a connector for the Coinbase Pro API to trade crypto currencies. 
In the works is a connector for Alpaca trading API which will allow you to trade stocks as well.

By integrating TradingView you can set buy and sell signals based on whatever indicators or market conditions you want. 
You can create a fully automated trading bot that buys and sells assets, although this is not recommended* (see disclaimer).

### Requirements
  1. Python
  2. Install and Configure [Chalice](https://aws.github.io/chalice/index.html)
  3. [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) Account (optional if you want to deploy the bot live)
  4. [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/) for Alert Triggers (or other trigger sources with webhooks)
  5. [Coinbase Pro](https://pro.coinbase.com/) account and api key
  6. [Alpaca Trading API](https://app.alpaca.markets/) **Implementation Coming Soon


## Installation
  1. First, [create a new Chalice project](https://aws.github.io/chalice/quickstart.html#creating-your-project)
  2. Clone the repo inside the new project directory
    
  ```bash
  cd 'Project directory name'
  git clone https://github.com/sletizia/serverless-trading-bot.git
  ```
  3. Move the repo files from its folder to the project foler, overwrite/replace chalice files with the repo files

  ```bash
  mv serverless-trading-bot/* .
  ```
  
  4. Make sure the chalice project runs locally
  ```bash
  chalice local
  ```

## Config
The config.json file is where you put your coinbase pro and alpaca api keys, trading account information, AWS S3 info and other configuration settings coming in the future. 
Json Schema:
```json
{
    "cbpro": {
        "apiKey": "",
        "apiPass": "",
        "apiSecret": "",
        "apiUrl": "",
        "accountIds": {
          "ETH-BTC": "example-account-id",
          "LTC-BTC": "another-account-id"
        },
        "stakeBTC": "0.0"
    },
    "s3": {
        "bucketName": ""
    },
    "alpaca": {
        "apiKey": "",
        "apiPass": "",
        "apiSecret": ""
    }
}
```
the `accountIds` element needs to be populated manually with an id for each coin you want to trade. To do that use the "get_accounts()" method from the cbpro package in the python cmd line console. You need your api key information for this step as well:

`python3` to open the cmd line python console or run this code from a file
```python
import cbpro

API_KEY="YOUR API KEY"
API_SECRET="YOUR API SECRET"
API_PASS="YOUR API PASSWORD"
API_URL="https://api.pro.coinbase.com"

auth_client = cbpro.AuthenticatedClient(API_KEY, API_SECRET, API_PASS, API_URL)
auth_client.get_accounts()
```
`auth_client.get_accounts()` returns a list of each of your crypto currency accounts with their id's. Pick the currencies you want to trade, extract the id, and add it to the config.json file

## Components

### Coinbase Pro Connector
Wrapper for the cbpro coinbase pro api.
#### Input: cbpro config settings (api key info and account ids)
#### Methods:
* get_current_price(pair) - returns a float, the current price of a crypto asset or pair
* get_balance(pair) - returns a float, the balance of one of your crypto accounts
* market_buy(pair) - executes a market buy order
* market_sell(pair, balance) - executes a market sell order

### S3 Connector
Wrapper for storing values in an AWS S3 bucket uses boto3
#### Input: S3 config settings (bucket name)
#### Methods: 
* get_last_buy_price(asset_name) - reutnrs a float, the last buy price stored in bucket
* set_last_buy_price(asset_name, close) - stores close price in bucket
* more coming soon

### Config Reader
Reads the config.json file and returns config settings
#### Methods: 
* load_config_from_file(configfilepath) - returns a dictionary, the elements stored in the config.json file
